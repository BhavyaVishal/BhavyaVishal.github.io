      I am learning to code .Specially i am polishing my web skills and
      acquiring new skills like django ,PhotoShop , PYTHON and little bit JS
      libraries like React native i began my coding journey by being inspired
      from Musk . I read that Musk developed a game at the age of 12 That
      Motivated me to code . So , that's how by googling the stuff and with
      mentors i am able to code to this extent
